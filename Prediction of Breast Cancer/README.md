# Neural-Network-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Classification

This repository contains a Python script for building and training a neural network model to classify breast cancer diagnoses based on features extracted from medical images. The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file (data.csv), containing relevant information about breast cancer cases.

**Prerequisites**

**Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:**
Pandas
NumPy
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib

**You can install these libraries using the following command:**
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

**Usage**

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git

**Run the Python script:**
python breast_cancer_classification.py

**The script performs the following steps:**

Reads the dataset from data.csv.
Preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Builds a deep neural network model for breast cancer diagnosis classification.
Trains the model using the training data and evaluates it using validation data.
Generates predictions using the trained model on the testing data.
Calculates a confusion matrix and displays it using a heatmap.

**File Description**
**breast_cancer_classification.py:** The main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
**data.csv:** The dataset file in CSV format containing breast cancer diagnostic information and features.
**README.md: **This README file providing information about the project.

**Results**
The script trains a neural network model to classify breast cancer diagnoses based on the provided dataset. The confusion matrix heatmap provides insights into the model's performance on the testing data.
